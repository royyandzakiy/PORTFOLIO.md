# My Work

Hi! This repository explores many of my intellectual produce

- [Engineering & Development Workflow](workflow.md): How I do Engineering and Product Development work
- [Software Projects Portfolio](portfolio.md): A collection of all my (github) work that are useful or interesting
- [Talks](talks.md): I do many talks, seminars, lectures; here I collect the scattered links

Note: This list is maintained manually, so expect it to expand slowly
